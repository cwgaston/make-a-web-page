  <div class="Topic">
  <h3>HTML</h3>
  <div class="Notes">
        <p>
        Content – what you see<br>
        Markup – what it looks like<br>
        References to other docs —like images/video (copied code from w3schools for picture below):<br>
        <img src="http://www.w3schools.com/images/w3schools_green.jpg">
        <br>Links to other pages<br>
        </p>
</div>
   <div>
      <h3>HTML Markup</h3>
      Plain text is plain text<br>
      Markup is made up of tags <br>
      Opening tag has brackets<br>
      Closing tag has / and brackets <br>
      Opening + closing tags = element<br>
      b tag – bold <br>
      em tag – emphasis – italics<br>
      </div>
      <div>
      <h3>HTML Attributes</h3>
      Attributes always = value<br>
      Can have multiple attributes<br>
      Anchor tag = a in brackets and it's for making links<br>
      href=attribute name<br>
      Value =url<br>
      Contents – derp<br>
      images=img in brackets<br>
      Src =source<br>
      Alt = text if image doesn’t load<br>
      Images don’t have a closing tag – because it has no content<br>
      </div>
      <div>
      <h3>Whitespace</h3>
      To make text on multiple lines add a break tag<br>
      This is a void tag – no need for closing tag<br>
      Paragraph tag can also be used and it is a block tag --which means there's an invisible block around it.<br>
      <h3>Inline vs Block</h3>
      The break tag is inline and so is <b>bold (b)</b>, <em>italics (em)</em>, and image (img)<br>
      P tag is block … makes an invisibile box<br>
      A box that can be resized/shaped around the first p tagged text<br>
      Span is inline<br>
      Div is block<br>
      </div>
      <div>
      <h3>HTML Documents</h3>
      In brackets with ! is the fact that it's an HTML doc<br>
      An opening tag and closing tag to surrounds the document html and then /html<br>
      Next is a head tag: meta data and other stuff, like if you want to use Javascript or CSS<br>
      Then a Title tag – which appears in your browser window as title<br>
      After title close your head tag<br>
      Then Body which is where we'll spend the bulk of time in this class<br>
      The tag here is "body"<br>
      And then don't forget to close the whole document with /html tag
      </div>

      <h3>Web Development</h3>
      Html, css, and javascript —all used in developing web dev
      Website – Like building a house
      <br><b>Html</b> are “walls” in the house
      <br><b>Css</b> - “style” color on the walls, decoration, etc
      <br><b>Javascript</b> – garage door opener, remote, etc
      <br>Also need tools
      <p>Chrome – Tools, Developer —can see structure of the page
        Elements and Styles
      Scratchpad.io —literally for own personal use/immediate feedback
      <br>Codepen – good for sharing
      <br>Sublime – works with all languages – most advanced
      </p>

    <b>NOTES COPIED FROM SCREEN:</b><br>
    HTML and CSS are both "languages"
    HTML controls the "structure" of a web page
    CSS controls the "style" of a page (how it looks).
    When programmers talk about the "DOM" (Document Object Model) they are talking about the tree-like structure of a page.

    <h2>Lesson 3 Notes</h2>
    <div class="Topic">
    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <div class="Notes">
    <p>CSS puts “style" to html elements
  
      Attribute (Color) then Description (Red)
      .description {color: red;}
      
      You can make an entire element a particular style
      Like – h1 —get a treatment
      h1 {
        Background-color : black;
        color: white;
      }
    </p>
        <p>
        Applying CSS Styling:
        Write CSS code in the <head> of your HTML (good for small projects)
        Link your HTML to a separate CSS file
        Write your style “inline” with your HTML (generally a bad idea bc lots of repeated code)
        </p>
        <p>
        CODE, TEST, REFINE
        Boxify
        Position on the screen
        Tag/Element it
        Write your HTML then apply Style
        </p>
